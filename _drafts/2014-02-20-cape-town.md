Cape Town - Wow! What a great place! We stead here a few days at the [BIG Backpackers](www.bigbackpackers.co.za), who took great care of us. We hiked Table Mountain and Lions Head, which had awesome views of the city. The waterfront area had great restaurants and bars. The oysters are delicious here. Overall food quality in Cape Town is amazing. The Woodstock market on the weekend was a hit. I got the most comfortable sandals there and the food stalls were so yummy. The local township tour that we took was most informative of the people that live there and their culture. We got offered a she eps head to eat and some local brewed beer. We went for the beer.. ;).

The beach was so nice too, we got to eat ice cream and relax over the most beautiful blue sky. Our favorite beaches were the Clifton beaches just a short drive from the BIG. The botanical garden was gorgeous and really relaxing. We learned all we can on fragrance and hell plants :). Tableview beach was really lovely too. The bar (forgot the name of it) we went to in order to see the sunset was super cool and the views of Cape Town are mesmerizing.
