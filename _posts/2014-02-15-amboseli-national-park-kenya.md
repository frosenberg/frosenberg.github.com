<div><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kws.org&#47;parks&#47;parks_reserves&#47;AMNP.html">Amboseli National Park<&#47;a> in Kenya was great - we got to see elephants, hyenas, various birds and monkeys! We had a great day looking at elephant families in the wild. We got to see a lot of babies and even one running and honking his little trunk. It was adorable. As you can see from the pictures - we even spotted a naughty monkey ;). The sunset was beautiful. We ended up staying in a really nice tented camp called <a title="Kibo Safari Camp" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kibosafaricamp.com" target="_blank">Kibo Safari Camp<&#47;a>, which was marvelous. We could see Kilimanjaro from our room. At night they had local Masai men dance the jumping dance, which I tried out :). It was quite entertaining. One of the Masai men was trying to sell Florian his shoes made of motorcycle tires for $25. Haha&hellip;<&#47;div><br />
