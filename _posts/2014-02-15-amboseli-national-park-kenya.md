[Amboseli National Park](http://www.kws.org/parks/parks_reserves/AMNP.html) in Kenya was great - we got to see elephants, hyenas, various birds and monkeys! We had a great day looking at elephant families in the wild. We got to see a lot of babies and even one running and honking his little trunk. It was adorable. As you can see from the pictures - we even spotted a naughty monkey ;). The sunset was beautiful. We ended up staying in a really nice tented camp called [Kibo Safari Camp](http://www.kibosafaricamp.com), which was marvelous. We could see Kilimanjaro from our room. At night they had local Masai men dance the jumping dance, which I tried out :). It was quite entertaining. One of the Masai men was trying to sell Florian his shoes made of motorcycle tires for $25. Haha.
