Johannesburg was not a great place for us. Our hotel room was broken into and the safe got stolen, incl. passport, iPad, Kindle etc. Before the break-in, we also had some good times ;). We went to a [Rhino and Lion Park](www.rhinolion.co.za) and got to pet baby lions, a jaguar and a cheetah. I was like a kid there.  This was a dream come true! Clearly, we haven't had enough safari yet. Later that day we went to [Carnivore](www.carnivore.co.za), a BBQ place of wild game meats in the suburbs of Johannesburg. It was a great experience for 20$ a person. Impala and warthog was my favorite. :). Another highlight of JoBurg is definitly the Apartheid Museum which we enjoyed a lot. Here are some impressions...
