<div>Johannesburg was not a great place for us. Our hotel room was broken into and the safe got stolen, incl. passport, iPad, Kindle etc. Before the break-in, we also had some good times ;). We went to a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rhinolion.co.za&#47;">Rhino and Lion Park<&#47;a>&nbsp;and got to pet baby lions, a jaguar and a cheetah. I was like a kid there. This was a dream come true! Later that day we went to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.carnivore.co.za">Carnivore<&#47;a>, a BBQ place of wild game meats in the suburbs of Johannesburg. It was a great experience for 20$ a person.&nbsp;Impala and warthog was my favorite. :)<&#47;div></p>
