The [Ngorongoro](https://plus.google.com/103770074587128924663/about?gl=at&hl=en) crater in Tanzania was one of our favorite parks. What a collection of animals! I think we saw everything under the sun here and we had a permanent smile on our faces from all the cute animals we saw. We spent the night at the [Ngorongoro Wildlife Lodge](http://www.hotelsandlodges-tanzania.com) which was very nice and had a great view from their terrace over the crater.
