<div>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Ngorongoro_Conservation_Area">Ngorongoro<&#47;a> crater in Tanzania was one of our favorite parks. What a collection of animals! I think we saw everything under the sun here and we had a permanent smile on our faces from all the cute animals we saw. We spent the night at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hotelsandlodges-tanzania.com&#47;properties&#47;en&#47;ngorongoro_index.php">Ngorongoro Wildlife Lodge<&#47;a> which was very nice and had a great view from their terrace over the crater.<&#47;div><br />
