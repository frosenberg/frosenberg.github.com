We went to Franschock and Stellenbosch to sample some wine farms. It was absolutely gorgeous in Franschock. We stayed in a little guesthouse run by a lovely lady. Her son John was kind enough to show us around town and take us to his favorite wine farms. It was so much fun!
We went to the following places:

 * Charmonix - very oaky white wines
 * Dieu Donne - amazing view from the farm and super relaxing outdoor tasting room
 * Haute Cabriere - cellar tour and Champaign tasting; was great
 * La Bri - cozy tasting room and great red wine
 * Grand Provance - pretty farm house and good wine
 * La Motte - very nice tasting room and good wine
 * Anthonij Rupert - best Chardonnay I have tasted and amazing wine overall
 * Rupert & Rothschild - amazing wine

We also went for a sunset on top of a mountain and ate at [French Connection](http://www.frenchconnection.co.za/), where I had the best muscles ever! Highly recommended!

In Stellenbosch, we went around this cute university town and visited the following wine farms:

 * De Morgenzon - beautiful farm and great wine
 * Reyneke - organic and biodynamic wines, very delicious
 * Jordan - pretty farm and awesome meat/cheese plate, good wine
 * Brenaissance - wine and pizza pairing was delicious
 * Stark-Conde Wines - beautiful lake on the farm and amazing wine
 * Creations - gorgeous farm, amazing food and super wine. Best creme brule ever!
