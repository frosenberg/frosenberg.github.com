 I loved Bangkok. The city is a mad house and it is exhilarating. The air is so smoggy and the tuk tuks are everywhere! The food carts line every step of the way and this is my dream :). 
 I think I ate something spicy or drank coconuts every few minutes. We did some local temple and palace watching, including the laying Buddha, which were gorgeous and super impressive. I have never seen so much gold! We visited a local floating market and Florian had to drag me out of there ;). I think we spent 5 hours there and I was still wanting to eat more food and try all the random thing they were selling. The foot massage ritual was part of our agenda every day. I tried the fish spa, which was hilarious! Durian fruit was an interesting experience. I ended up stinking up the hotel room with a tiny piece I brought home, but it was tasty I must admit. Bangkok trip is never without an adventure I hear.. so lets say we did not leave town without me almost getting in a fight with a street vendor, ping pong show, seeing ladyboys, drinking quite a few Chang beers and buying a frog noise maker. It was a good time for sure!
