Finally, I managed to update my website to the latest [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) version and the latest version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. This allowed me to get rid of all my vulnerability warning that Github used to send me over the years.

I'll keep this updated as the months fly by. My next projects is the [About](/about) page, followed by my publications page. I have not published much lately but I want to keep a permanent record for myself here.
