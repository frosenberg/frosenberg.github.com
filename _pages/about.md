Currently, I'm the Global Head of Engineering at [AIM Software GmbH](https://aimsoftware.com) in Vienna responsible for the GAIN EDM (Enterprise Data Management) product suite.

Before that, I held various leadership positions most noteably I spent some wonderful years at IBM in Vienna and New York and CSIRO/Data61 in Australia. I got to spend a lot of time working on cool stuff related to AI/ML services (such as [IBM DLaaS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/deep-learning)), Cloud, DevOps tooling that resulted in a number of patents as well. 

I was also foruntate enough to spend some wonderful years in academia. I completed my PhD in June 2009 at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria where I worked at the [Distributed Systems Group](http://dsg.tuwien.ac.at). My main focus was on service-oriented architectures and how to engineer resilient applications that are composed of microservices, just that we did not call it microservice back then.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my familiy, being outdoors and various kinds of sports like Crossfit (proud member of [CF Vienna](http://crossfitvienna.at)) and snowboarding.
