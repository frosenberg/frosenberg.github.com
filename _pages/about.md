Currently, I'm the CTO of [Crayon](https://www.crayon.com/). I am responsible for driving innovation and technical expertise globally in our customer-first services, products and platforms, with a focus on cloud, data & AI, the modern workplace and security. I also ensure we have data-oriented strategies to best scale our success worldwide and that we are a top place to work for technology enthusiasts.

Before taking the CTO role, I was a VP for Data & AI technologies and the mastermind behind Crayon's Data & AI Center of Excellence. I was responsible for the technical strategy of the AI practise, technical delivery and I lead the Data Science and Engineering teams.

Before that, I held various leadership positions most notably I spent some wonderful years at IBM in Vienna and New York and CSIRO/Data61 in Australia. I got to spend a lot of time working on cool stuff related to AI/ML services (such as [IBM DLaaS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/deep-learning)), Cloud, DevOps tooling that resulted in a number of patents as well.

I was also fortunate enough to spend some wonderful years in academia. I completed my PhD in June 2009 at [TU Wien](http://www.tuwien.ac.at), Austria where I was a member of the [Distributed Systems Group](http://dsg.tuwien.ac.at). My main focus was on service-oriented architectures, in particular how to engineer resilient applications that are composed of microservices, just that we did not call it microservices back then.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, being outdoors and various kinds of sports like Crossfit (proud member of [CF Vienna](http://crossfitvienna.at)) and snowboarding.
