## Open Source Projects

1. [Fabric for Deep Learning](https://github.com/IBM/FfDL). I was the originator of the project  with [Rania Khalaf](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-rkhalaf) during my IBM days. The goal was to create a framework independent training infrastructure for deep learning models on distributed servers (CPUs and GPUs). 

2. [Spring Cloud Dataflow for Kubernetes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/). I wrote the first implementation for Kubernetes allowing Spring Cloud Dataflow pipelines to be executed on a Kubernetes cluster. 

## Patents

1. **Systems management based on semantic models and low-level runtime state**\\
    **Patent number**: 10203948\\
    **Abstract**: Various embodiments manage deployable computing environments. In one embodiment, a semantic model of a computing environment is analyzed. The computing environment is deployed based on the analysis of the semantic model. The deployment of the computing environment includes executing one or more automation scripts. One or more changes in a state of the computing environment are identified, for each automation script executed during the deployment of the computing environment, based on executing the automation script. The semantic model is updated based on the one or more changes in state identified for each automation script.\\

1. **Implicit coordination for deployment of computing systems using a data sharing service**\\
    **Patent number**: 9733856\\
    **Abstract**: Various embodiments manage deployable computing environments. In one embodiment, a system model of a computing environment that includes a set of computing resources is analyzed. The system model at least describes properties of each of the set of computing nodes and identifies a plurality of configuration operations to be executed by each of the set of computing nodes during deployment. A set of dependency information is generated for each of the set of computing nodes based on analyzing the system model. The set of dependency information identifies at least one dependency between two or more of the plurality of configuration operations. An executable coordination operation is added to each of the plurality of configuration operations. The executable coordination operation automatically coordinates execution of the plurality of configuration operations on the computing node.\\
