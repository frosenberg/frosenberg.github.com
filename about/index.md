I've joined IBM Research in January 2011, where I'm currently a Research Staff Member. I'm not doing much core research these days. In fact, I hack on a lot of interesting projects. I love the idea of DevOps and all the technical and organizational challenges that come with it. This is why I'm starting this blog.

Before IBM, I was a Research Scientist with the CSIRO ICT Centre in Australia. I completed my PhD in June 2009 at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria where I worked at the [Distributed Systems Group](http://dsg.tuwien.ac.at). My current work focus is on DevOps and Cloud computing, in particular software configuration and continuous deployment incl. scaling, failure recovery, updates, etc.

In my free time, I enjoy various kinds of sports, mostly, running, cycling, swimming and in winter snowboarding. I also enjoy a glass of good wine and scotch.
